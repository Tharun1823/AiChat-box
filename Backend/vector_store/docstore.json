For example:\n   - **Red**: Critical issues that need immediate attention.\n   - **Amber**: Warning signs that require monitoring but are not critical.\n   - **Green**: Everything is on track.\n\n2. **Create Test Cases**: Develop test cases that cover various scenarios. For example:\n   - A project that is behind schedule (should be Red).\n   - A project that is at risk but manageable (should be Amber).\n   - A project that is on schedule (should be Green).\n\n3. **Simulate Data**: Input data into the system that reflects the different statuses. Ensure that the data aligns with the criteria you defined.\n\n4. **Run Tests**: Execute the tests and observe the output. Check if the RAG status reflects the expected results based on the input data.\n\n5. **Review and Validate**: Compare the actual results with the expected results. Validate that the RAG functionality is working correctly.\n\n6. **User Feedback**: If applicable, gather feedback from users who will be using the RAG functionality to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.\n\n7. **Document Findings**: Record the results of your tests, including any issues or discrepancies, and document any necessary changes or improvements.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively test the RAG functionality in your project or system.
